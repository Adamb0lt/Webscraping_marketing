    "This project involves scraping data from multiple retail websites and analyzing the collected data. The goal is to extract useful information and insights from the collected data. We will be scraping the following websites:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Miss Etam](https://www.missetam.nl/nl/collectie/jurken/)**: Miss Etam is a European retail store based in the Netherlands. We will be extracting information about their dress collection, including details such as product names, prices, urls, brand etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[Gap](https://www.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=5664&nav=meganav%3AWomen%3ACategories%3AJeans#pageId=0&department=136)**: Gap is a major American retailer. We will be collecting data on women's jeans, including product names, prices, styles, urls, brand etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **[Your Look for Less](https://www.your-look-for-less.nl/goedkope-blouses)**: Your Look for Less is a European retail store based in a non-English speaking country. We will be gathering details on their blouse collection, such as product names, prices, urls, brand etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "The collected data will be consolidated into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis. Each section of this notebook will detail the steps involved in scraping data from each site, followed by a comprehensive data analysis section.\n",

The collected data was then merged into a single pandas DataFrame, providing a unified and comprehensive dataset of product details across these retailers. This consolidated DataFrame was saved as a CSV file, making it readily available for further analysis, reporting, or integration into other systems.\n",
